## Paragraph

This is an experimental space dedicated to sharing ideas, skills, and information related to AI and Data Science in Rwanda.

While there are various channels for discussing AI in Rwandaâ€”such as WhatsApp groups, meetups, and platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn
This space complements those efforts by:

- Allowing for longer-form content beyond the limitations of platforms like WhatsApp.
- Providing search functionality to access past announcements and discussions.
- Enabling code sharing, including more extensive explanations through repositories like GitHub.

We hope readers find this space helpful.
